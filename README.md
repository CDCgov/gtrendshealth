## Overview

This package connects to the Google Trends for Health API to query
Google Trends for projects authorized to use the health research data.
It fetches a graph of search volumes per time within a set of
restrictions. Each term will result in a timeline of search over time.
Note the data is sampled and Google canâ€™t guarantee the accuracy of the
numbers. This service is closed to a subset of Health researchers. The
quota provision is individually maintained by the Trends team.

You will need an API key from your Google Developer project authorized
for Google Trends for Health API use. A key can be acquired by
requesting access at
<https://support.google.com/trends/contact/trends_api> and following the
setup instructions.

## Usage

After receiving access to the Google Trends for Health API and setting
up your Google Developer project, generate an API key, and set it up for
use in your R installation:

``` r
library(package = "gtrendshealth")

set_gt_api_key(
  key = "{your-key}",
  install = TRUE
)
```

By default, the key is installed in the `.Renviron` file in your home
folder, and will be loaded into the `GOOGLE_TRENDS_FOR_HEALTH_API_KEY`
environment variable every time you start R. If you only want the key
for the active session, use `install = FALSE`.

``` r
library(package = "gtrendshealth")

# Query the Google Trends for Health service
monthly_trends <- get_health_trends(
  terms = "fever",
  resolution = "month",
  start = as.Date("2024-01-01"),
  end = as.Date("2024-12-31"),
  country = "US"
)

# set a date for each monthly observation
# using the 15th of each month for the day
monthly_trends$date <- as.Date(
  strptime(
    paste("15", monthly_trends$period),
    format = "%d %b %Y"
  )
)

head(monthly_trends)

# Query the Google Trends for Health service
daily_trends <- get_health_trends(
  terms = "fever",
  resolution = "day",
  start = as.Date("2024-01-01"),
  end = as.Date("2024-12-31"),
  country = "US"
)

head(daily_trends)

# plot the time series
plot(
  daily_trends$date, daily_trends$value, type = "l", col = "blue",
  xlab = "Date",
  ylab = "Value",
  main = "Daily and Monthly Trends for Fever in the US, 2024"
)
lines(monthly_trends$date, monthly_trends$value, col = "red", lwd = 2)
legend("topleft", legend = c("Daily Trends", "Monthly Trends"),
       col = c("blue", "red"), lty = 1, lwd = c(1, 2))
```
